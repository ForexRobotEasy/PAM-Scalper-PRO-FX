## Input Parameters
- `period` (int): The period for analyzing historical data. Default value is 14.
- `threshold` (double): The threshold for identifying high liquidity zones. Default value is 0.5.
- `momentumThreshold` (double): The threshold for institutional money flow momentum. Default value is 0.2.

## Global Variables
- `liquidityZones` (double[]): Array to store identified high liquidity zones.
- `supplyZones` (double[]): Array to store identified supply zones.
- `demandZones` (double[]): Array to store identified demand zones.

## Functions
1. `analyzeHistoricalData()`: Custom indicator to analyze historical price action and volume.
2. `identifyLiquidityZones()`: Function to determine high liquidity zones.
3. `determineSupplyAndDemandZones()`: Function to determine supply and demand zones.
4. `extrapolateBuySellAreas()`: Function to extrapolate areas for buying or selling.
5. `enterTrades()`: Function to enter trades based on identified zones and momentum.
6. `optimizeAndEnhanceStrategies()`: Function to optimize trading strategies and enhance trade execution.
7. `testAndDebugCode()`: Function to test and debug the code.

## Program Execution
The program execution starts with the `OnStart()` function. The necessary functions are called in a logical sequence to perform the trading strategy:

1. `analyzeHistoricalData()`: Analyzes historical price action and volume data and stores the results in the `liquidityZones`, `supplyZones`, and `demandZones` arrays.
2. `identifyLiquidityZones()`: Identifies high liquidity zones based on the analysis and stores the results in the `liquidityZones` array.
3. `determineSupplyAndDemandZones()`: Determines supply and demand zones based on the analysis and stores the results in the `supplyZones` and `demandZones` arrays.
4. `extrapolateBuySellAreas()`: Extrapolates areas for buying or selling based on historical data. Uses the results from the `liquidityZones`, `supplyZones`, and `demandZones` arrays.
5. `optimizeAndEnhanceStrategies()`: Optimizes trading strategies and enhances trade execution using the results from the `liquidityZones`, `supplyZones`, and `demandZones` arrays.
6. `enterTrades()`: Enters trades based on the identified zones and momentum. Uses the results from the `liquidityZones`, `supplyZones`, and `demandZones` arrays, and the `momentumThreshold`.
7. `testAndDebugCode()`: Tests and debugs the code to ensure accurate identification of high liquidity zones.
